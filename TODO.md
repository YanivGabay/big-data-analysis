- [X] Create a `requirements.txt` file with the necessary dependencies.
- [X] Create a `main.py` file that will be the entry point of the application.
- [X] Create a `modules` directory with the following modules:
  - [X] `loader.py`: responsible for loading the data.
  - [ ] `processor.py`: responsible for processing the data.
  - [ ] `analyzer.py`: responsible for analyzing the data.
  - [ ] `visualizer.py`: responsible for visualizing the data.
  - [ ] Each module should have a function that receives the data and returns the processed data. (maybe a different approach is better)
